# SPA with .NET6 and Angular14 over Nx

This .NET solution has a .NET project generated by `dotnet new angular` and modified to work with an Angular app under a Nx workspace.

## Directory Structure

* `/angular-14`: .NET solution directory
* `/js-workspace`: Nx workspace

## How to run

1. Go to `/angular-14` directory, and run `dotnet start`
1. Go to `/js-workspace` directory and run `npx nx serve`

## REMARKS

* To show how Nx makes it easy to use *Angular Library*, an Angular library is added at `/js-workspace/libs/weather` and `fetch-data` component, which is one of the generated code, is moved to it.

* The .NET project contains an Angular app at `/angular-14/ClientApp`, but it is *not* actually in use.
  It is generated code by the `angular` template and left as it was generated so that we can conpare it with the one that is migrated to the Angular app project under the Nx workspace.
