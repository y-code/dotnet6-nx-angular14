# SPA with .NET6 and Angular14 over Nx

This .NET solution has a .NET project generated by `dotnet new angular` and modified to work with an Angular app under a Nx workspace.

## NOTES
* The .NET project contains an Angular app at `/angular-14/ClientApp`, but it is not actually in use.
  It is generated code by the `angular` template and left as it was generated so that we can conpare it with the one that is migrated to the Angular app project under the Nx workspace.
